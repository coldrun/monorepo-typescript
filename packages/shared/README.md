# Shared

Generic, framework-agnostic building blocks shared across packages.

This package is intended to contain fully generic code only:

- no product/domain logic
- no service-specific wiring
- no dependencies on other monorepo packages
- no runtime environment assumptions (Node vs browser) unless explicitly documented
