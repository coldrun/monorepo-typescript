# Core

Core domain logic and business rules shared across services and applications.

This package is intended to be the **single source of truth for the domain**:

- business concepts and terminology
- domain-specific types and value objects
- validation and invariants
- pure business rules and policies

It is intentionally **framework- and infrastructure-agnostic**.
